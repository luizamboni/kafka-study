Kafka Study
===

This is a dummy project with the purpose of kafka study with the use of some small examples to cover some topics.

- log compression;
- order consuming;
- messaging schemas;
- schemas formats (Akron, JSON, Protobuffer, etc);
- replay, foward and rewind of the messagens in a topic;
- cluster management (creation, deletion and scaling);
- [kSQL](https://www.confluent.io/blog/ksql-streaming-sql-for-apache-kafka/) uses;
- alternatives do Docker (extra topic);
- and more ...

We will use [coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api/documentation) API to give some contexts to project and make it more tasty.

This project uses docker and docker-compose in order to create local environments and Makefile to automatize some tasks.
