Kafka Study
===

This project is a dummy study of kafka with small examples to cover some topics.

- log compactation
- message schemas
- consume orders
- and more

We will use [coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api/documentation) API to give some contexts to project and make it more tasty.

We are using docker-composes to create local environments with Makefile to automatize some tasks.
